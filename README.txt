Project created for a game design course at Western University. 

Contains two custom editors for use in game development. One is a localization editor that allows the designer to automatically replace phrases used throughout the game scenes with equivalent phrases from different languages. The second is a dialog editor which allows users to create node like conversations with branching paths. Values in this editor can also be swapped out by the localization editor for language changes.

Currently in the project is very basic scene to demonstrate functionality. 

Locaization editor used to add french and english language.

The conversation is a simple UI conversation using number inputs for responses. It contains dialogs with more than 3 options and cyclic dialogs.
